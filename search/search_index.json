The goal this project was to precisely determine a specific time for legal  twilight or what is commonly known as the true dawn by making consistent individual  observations by naked eyes and highly technical cameras for two years. Research was conducted in desert areas such as Sahra\u2019 ad-Dahna\u2019and \u2018Irq al-Hamrani, almost 170 kilometers from Riyadh. They concluded that the appointed time for Fajr starts when the sun\u2019s center is 14.6 degrees below horizon. Difference between 14.6 and 19 degrees, the recent degree adopted by Umm al-Qura Calendar, may be transferred to approximately 21 minutes difference. The main reason of error, according to the report of the committee, is that those who set Umm al-Qura Calendar did not distinguish between false and true dawns. Observations were made two days a month during two periods of time, the first extending from sunset to \u2018Isha\u2019 time, and the other from midnight up to sunrise. This experiment was conducted in an isolated area in order to avoid any possible light effects. Researchers recorded their notes individually so that the results of their researches seemed objective.</p> <p>Ahmad An-Najmi, being questioned on whether Muslims should abide by prayer tables shown in calendars even if they are not able to sight true dawn, he said \u201cA Muslim is not to abide by it then since Allah does not place a burden beyond one\u2019s capabilities.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"truefajr/#whats-the-solution","title":"What\u2019s the solution?","text":"<p>You will need to find the correct angle for your location by visually sighting True Fajr, which can be observed before Nautical Twilight.
