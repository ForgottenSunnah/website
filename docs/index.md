!!! tip "Sunnah after Salah"

    The Messenger of Allah (peace & blessings be upon him) said:

    "Whoever glorifies Allah (by saying **Subhan-Allah**) after every Salat (prayer) thirty-three times, and praises Allah (by saying **Alhamdu-lillah**) thirty-three times, and exalts Allah (by saying **Allahu Akbar**) thirty-three times, those are ninety-nine in all, and says to complete a hundred: **La ilaha ill-Allahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahulhamdu, wa Huwa 'ala kulli shai'in Qadir** (There is nothing which deserves to be worshipped except Allah Alone Who has no partner; to Him belongs the kingdom, to Him praise is due, and He has power over everything), his sins will be forgiven, even if they are as abundant as the foam of the sea." [Reported by Muslim]

!!! danger "Allah Seals the Heart of those who Neglects Jummah"

    The Messenger of Allah (peace & blessings be upon him) said on the pulpit:
    
    “Let people stop neglecting Jumu’ah, or Allah will place a seal on their hearts, then they will be among those who are neglectful.” [Narrated by Muslim, 865]

    The Messenger of Allah (peace & blessings be upon him) said:

    “Whoever neglects three Jumu’ahs, Allah will place a seal on his heart.” [Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1052; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 928]


!!! tip "Sending Blessings Upon the Prophet on Jummah"

    The Messenger of Allah (peace & blessings be upon him) said:

    “Increase your supplications for me on the day and night of Friday. Whoever blesses me once, Allah will bless him ten times.” [Source: al-Sunan al-Kubrá 5854, Grade: Hasan (fair) according to Al-Albani]


!!! example "Two Words Beloved to Allah"

    The Messenger of Allah (peace & blessings be upon him) said:

    "(There are) two words which are beloved to The Most Merciful, (they are) very light (easy) for the tongue (to say), but very heavy in the balance. They are: **Subhan Allah wa-bi hamdihi and Subhan Allah Al-`Azim**" [Sahih al-Bukhari 7563]

    To completely appreciate this hadith, you will need to read it in Arabic. Here is a word-by-word translation with transliteration:

    "Kalimatani (two words) Habibatani (two beloved) ila-Ar-Rahmani (The Most Merciful), Khafifatani (two light) elal-lisani (on the tongue), Thaqilatani (two heavy) filmizani (in the balance), Subhan Allah wa-bi hamdihi, Subhan Allah Al-`Azim."
