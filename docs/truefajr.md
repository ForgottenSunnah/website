# True Fajr between 12 degree & 18 degree

__Incorrect/False Fajr time on some Ramadan calendars and Azan Apps__

As-salāmu Alaykum,


Some masajids in Australia provided incorrect Fajr time in Ramadan timetables because they calculated Fajr time when the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon, which gives the Astronomical Twilight, also known as False Fajr.

What’s the impact? Your Fajr salah will be invalid because you will be praying 20-40 minutes before the actual Fajr time.

Prominent Muslim scholars and astronomers spoke about this issue in the 1980s and 1990s. We are providing you with their statements along with reference: 

## Taqiyy ad-Din al-Hilali (he translated Sahih Bukhari and the Quran to english)

In Morocco, for instance, where the Egyptian calendar is widely accepted, Taqiyy ad-Din al-Hilali, provided that the prayer timetable do not conform to the legal precise timing for Fajr, he remarked, “I found out upon conducting optimum researches and investigations and oft-recurrent physical observations that time set for Fajr prayer does not correspond to time stipulated by Shari‘ah. Fajr is announced before being identified according to signs expounded by Shari‘ah”.

## Sheikh Ibn al-Uthaymin (a scholar from Saudi Arabia who used to teach classes at Masjid al-haram in Mecca and he was also a professor of Sharia. He passed away in 2001 at age 73)

Sheikh Ibn al-‘Uthaymin used to request the person calling for Fajr to delay it for a while. He commented that Umm al-Qura tables show Fajr 5 minutes earlier than its supposed time. He further stated that some people observed the appearance of Fajr 20 minutes after set times as shown in calendars. He preferred to delay observance of Fajr from 20 to 25 minutes until exact time is being ascertained. In response to a question on which calendar a person should follow in case of differences, he preferred to act upon the later.

## Sheikh Nāsir ad-Dīn al-Albānī

Shaykh al-Albani proposed adding 20 to 30 minutes. His conclusion was based on physical sighing in ‘Amman. 

## Shaykh Ahmad b. Yahya an-Najmi

Shaykh Ahmad b. Yahya an-Najmi, the Mufi of southern areas of Saudi Arabia observed Fajr 
for many years and came up with the conclusion that 20 minutes must be added to timetables. 

## Dr. Sulayman b. Ibrahim Ath-Thanyan 

He observed true dawn for a full year concluding that Umm al-Qura calendar is 15 to 24 minutes earlier than precisely exact timing for Fajr, differing in accordance with seasons. Such a conclusion was also reached by ‘Abdullah b. Ibrahim at-Turkiwho sought help of individual witnesses to substantiate his testimony. He did not provide a precise period of difference between exact time and seemingly erroneous calculations of Umm al-Qura calendar.

## Others

In the Indian subcontinent Mufi Rashid Ahmed advised that Fajr, in these circumstances, should be performed at least 20 minutes after the beginning time shown in Pakistani timetables.

Mustafa al-‘Adawi who conducted his research in Egypt, confirmed that at least 20 minutes must be added. Shaykh ‘Adawi referred to a religious verdict issued by the former grand imam of al-Azhar, Shaykh Jad al-Haq and published in the news.

More organized and well-known project was launched by Twilight Committee affiliated of 
King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology and headed by Prof. Zaki b. ‘Abdur-
Rahman al-Mustafa. The goal this project was to precisely determine a specific time for legal 
twilight or what is commonly known as the true dawn by making consistent individual 
observations by naked eyes and highly technical cameras for two years. Research was conducted in desert areas such as Sahra’ ad-Dahna’and ‘Irq al-Hamrani, almost 170 kilometers from Riyadh. They concluded that the appointed time for Fajr starts when the sun’s center is 14.6 degrees below horizon. Difference between 14.6 and 19 degrees, the recent degree adopted by Umm al-Qura Calendar, may be transferred to approximately 21 minutes difference. The main reason of error, according to the report of the committee, is that those who set Umm al-Qura Calendar did not distinguish between false and true dawns. Observations were made two days a month during two periods of time, the first extending from sunset to ‘Isha’ time, and the other from midnight up to sunrise. This experiment was conducted in an isolated area in order to avoid any possible light effects. Researchers recorded their notes individually so that the results of their researches seemed objective.

Ahmad An-Najmi, being questioned on whether Muslims should abide by prayer tables shown in calendars even if they are not able to sight true dawn, he said “A Muslim is not to abide by it then since Allah does not place a burden beyond one’s capabilities.”

## What’s the solution?

You will need to find the correct angle for your location by visually sighting True Fajr, which can be observed before Nautical Twilight. Then change the settings in your azan app to use a custom angle to calculate Fajr time. 

There are three types of twilight, Astronomical Twilight (False Fajr), Nautical Twilight and Civil Twilight. You can get the times for these twilights by searching them on google with the name of your city and then select the search result from timeanddate.com. Then try to sight True Fajr before Nautical Twilight.
